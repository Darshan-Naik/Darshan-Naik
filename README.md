# Darshan Naik  
**SDE 3 at Meesho • Frontend Architect • Creator of Qortex and Vault**

I design and ship thoughtful, elegant front-end systems.  
At Meesho, I help lead the evolution of **Web Platform, Performance and Frontend Engineering** across high-scale product surfaces.

My work sits at the intersection of design, performance and engineering craftsmanship.

## What I Build

### **Qortex — Minimal, Modular async Query/Data Management for React**
Creator & Maintainer

Qortex is designed for engineers who value:
- predictable, simple state models  
- zero unnecessary rerenders  
- modular stores with composable APIs  
- a DX that feels “invisible”  

**Website:** https://qortex.darshannaik.com  
**Install:** `npm i qortex-react`

### **Vault — A screat store for your passwords**
Creator & Maintainer

Vault is designed for people who want to store their secrets securely with privacy-first architecture and modern security practices.
- **Zero-Knowledge Security** — Your password and recovery key are never stored or transmitted
- **End-to-End Encryption** — All vault data is encrypted client-side using AES-256-CBC
- **Master Key Architecture** — A unique master key encrypts your data, protected by your password
- **Recovery Key Backup** — One-time recovery key for password reset (invalidated after use)
- **Biometric Support** — Use fingerprint or face recognition or pin for quick unlock
- **PWA Ready** — Install as a native-like app on any device

**Website:** https://vault.darshannaik.com

### **Apps & Experiments**
A curated portfolio of micro-products, utilities and UI explorations.  
I use this space to prototype ideas, test patterns and experiment with UI motion and architecture.

## Approach & Principles
- Build products, not just software  
- Prefer clarity over cleverness  
- Systems should feel inevitable, not accidental  
- Fast iteration beats heavy planning  
- Developer experience matters as much as user experience
